# CivicCop Blockchain ‚Äì Vault-Lock System with cCOP

This repository contains the evolving implementation of a blockchain-based vault-lock system designed to simulate public procurement flows using the **Colombian peso‚Äìpegged stablecoin cCOP**, developed by Mentolabs.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

Clone the repository and enter the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CivicCop-Blockchain.git
cd CivicCop-Blockchain
bun install
bun run dev
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires access to cCOP on the Alfajores testnet to function properly.

## üì¶ Current Version ‚Äì Milestone 1

**Vault-Lock with cCOP Testnet**

This version demonstrates how public contracts can lock funds until conditions are met (e.g., product delivery, audit verification). As a simplification, funds are locked for a few seconds before being released, proving that **cCOP flows correctly on-chain**.

### ‚úÖ Delivered

- Smart contract deployed and verified on Alfajores testnet
- Integration with cCOP stablecoin
- Local testing environment fully functional
- UI components scaffolded (not yet operational)

### üîó Contract Addresses

- **Vault-Lock Contract (cCOP testnet)**  
  [`0xe6A57340f0df6E020c1c0a80bC6E13048601f0d4`](https://alfajores.celoscan.io/address/0xe6A57340f0df6E020c1c0a80bC6E13048601f0d4)

- **Developer Wallet (for verification)**  
  [`0x6Dcbd404e62151Bea13e3670b231F5846AB1dA97`](https://alfajores.celoscan.io/address/0x6Dcbd404e62151Bea13e3670b231F5846AB1dA97)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Alfajores faucet and swap services are currently down. Migration to Celo Sepolia and updated cCOP support is pending.

---

## üß≠ Coming Soon ‚Äì Milestone 2

- Fully functional UI for vault creation and tracking
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Support for multiple tokens beyond cCOP
- Migration to Celo Sepolia testnet (pending ecosystem updates)
